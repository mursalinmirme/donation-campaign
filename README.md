3 Features about Donation campaign project are...
➊ Home Page: I have make a home page. Which I kept as a root page. There has two division. The first has banner section and the second part is donation cards section. Banner background has donation picture under the overlay. and on the overlay has a title and search bar. The search bar I have make dynamic functionality. Like when a user will search by category name he will see the specific category items in the donation cards section. If the search value did not match with any category he will see a message. The cards section has all the items as a default. But, if a user will search a valid category name then the cards section will show the specific categories cards.

➋ Donatin Page: Donation page is make for showing the total donation cards. Like when a user will make a donate it will store in localStorage and this page makes for showing the stored cards. There has a speicialities which are the cards UI. I have make all the cards as the same color combination. Like when a user will make a donation. This donatin cards colors and background will be the donation page cards color and bg as the same design of selected donation card. There has a condition which are if a user never make a donation he will see a messege. and if a user make more than 4 donations. Then the donation page will show 4 items with show a see all button. If the user will click the see all button. He will see all the donations list cards.

➌ Statistics Page: Statistics page has a speiciality feature. I have make a pie chart by using rechart library. And this chart is dynamic. This chart make for see the donation condition of an user. It's awsome there has two dynamic levels one for total donation cards length and one for your donation makes. And it's dynamic like when a user has not made a donation the the total donatin values will be 100 percentage which fill color is red. the green color is used the see the percentage how much donation you have made.
